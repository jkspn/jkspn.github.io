        <h1>Testing out Github Pages</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm <strong>John</strong>. This is a series of almost-daily experiments in HTML/CSS/JS, in an attempt to really lock-in knowledge in building websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I learned about all of these things more than ten years ago, the field has changed so much, and this is an honest-to-goodness catching-up of what is there to see and learn.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll post links to different pages I've made, with one page each day of <del>working</del> playing. At the end of each page I'll put in what I learned that day, and relevant documentation and pages I used. In the future maybe I'll post a
          roadmap and milestone the hell out of this, but for now I'm just enjoying hand-coding this and <em>merging</em> in Github.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the best,
        </p>

          <li>I've been making websites in Wordpress for quite some time now but I feel I need to have a space where I can play around and gain a deeper and more extensive knowledge about it.</li>
