        <p><strong>Wow.</strong> This is amazing.</p>
        <p>I would've liked to have found out about this way back. I'm trying to make a portfolio website see, and at the same time learn more about coding websites by hand. All for a <strong>strong</strong> background on modern HTML/CSS/JS methods with an <em>emphasis</em> on learning new things.</p>
        <strong>Good thing I haven't started with my Notion portfolio yet.</strong> Maybe I'll resort to using this as a launchpad after all.</p>
        <p>All the best,</p>
